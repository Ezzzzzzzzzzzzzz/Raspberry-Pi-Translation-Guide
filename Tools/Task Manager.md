# How to use the Task Manager

If you are available to help us with a project, go to Task Manager (you should have received the link from our translation manager), select your language from  among the tabs at the bottom of the spreadsheet (see below), and look up the project’s name.

Then type in your name in the spreadsheet cell labelled with the task that you have taken on: **Translation**, **Review**, or **Testing**. Please do not add your name under more than one step for the same project - we want different volunteers to perform the translation, review and testing of a project.

We make tasks available on a first come, first served basis, so if the relevant cell already contains a name, it means that someone else has taken on the project. In such a case, please do not replace their name with yours.

## For translators

If you’re a translator and have added your name to the Task Manager, you can start translating straight away. When you start translating, please set the **Translation status** cell to **In progress** (see below) to let us know that you’ve begun the task. Once you’ve finished, please set the cell to **Finished** to let the reviewer know that they can start their job.

To open your chosen project in Crowdin, click the **Link for Translation** in the Task Manager:

Note: If you access Crowdin via the **Link for Translation** you will be assigned the role of **translator** permanently and won't be able to proofread a project even if you use the **Link for Review** (see below). If for some reason you need to access the project you translated in a proofreading mode, you will need to leave the project (see screenshot below) and join again via the **Link for Review**.

## For reviewers

Before you start reviewing, please wait for the **Translation status** cell in Task Manager to be set to **Finished**. Once you’ve begun your review, set the **Review status** cell to **In progress**, and to **Finished** when appropriate.

To review the translation of the project, please use the **Link for review** (as above).

## For testers

Before you start testing, please wait for the **Review status** cell in Task Manager to be set to **Finished** and wait for the link to the test version of the project to appear in the **Link for test** column. Once you’ve begun your test, set the **Testing status** cell to **In progress**, and then to **Finished** when appropriate.

- In the **Link for test** column, we will provide a link to a test version of the project that we’ll have generated for you. Please go through the project step by step to make sure it works well and that there are no problems along the way.

- If you come across issues that make it difficult or impossible to progress with the project, please let us know: select the **Issues found** option in the **Testing Feedback** cell in Task Manager, and fill in a report form (you can access it by clicking [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd1136TVh8zdM7u8k3U1a6XXCq0H-yrhYp-YbvP36pLiun6Bg/viewform?pli=1) or clicking on the **Testing Feedback** cell in the Task Manager and following the hyperlink).

## Other information

The Task Manager contains some other helpful information, such as:

- Link to the published version of the English project (if available) - click on the project's name to access the hyperlink.
- Project's category - this is most likely going to be Python, Scratch or Web development.
- Priority - please prioritise projects that are marked as HIGH priority.
- Deadline - this indicates when we need the translation to be ready.
