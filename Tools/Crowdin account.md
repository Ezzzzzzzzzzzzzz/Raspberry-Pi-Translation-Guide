# How to set up a Crowdin account

To translate and review project instructions, you are going to use Crowdin. You can set up an account in three easy steps:

1. Go to [crowdin.com](https://crowdin.com/) and click **Sign Up**. You will be asked for an email address, username, and password. Please use the same email address that you use to contact us, and make sure your username consists of your first name and surname (e.g. name.surname, name_surname).

Click the icon in the top right-hand corner of the screen (see image below), and choose **Settings** to go to your account settings. Add your full name, and from **My Languages**, select only your native language(s) (if English is your native language, please select your most fluent foreign languages).

3.	Go to your email inbox — you should have received a verification email from Crowdin (check your spam folder if you can’t see one). Follow the instructions in the email to verify your account.
