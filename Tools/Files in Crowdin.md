# Translating different types of files in Crowdin

When you open a project in Crowdin (by clicking the relevant link in Task Manager) and choose your language from those available, you will see the project folders and files:

The main folder is called **master** and it contains a folder called **en** where you'll find all of the project folders and files that need translating. Below, we explain what to do with the **images folder**, the **resources folder**, the **yml file** and the **markdown files**.

## images folder

This folder contains graphic files and videos/gifs that visualise the various steps in the project instructions. Graphic files should be translated whenever they contain text. 

- For Python and Web Development projects, graphic files will mostly include screenshots of Trinket so please use your translated Trinket. The Trinket only contains initial code (or no code at all) so you will have to recreate some of the steps - please follow the project instructions.

- For Scratch projects, this will mostly involve screenshots of Scratch Editor. You can use the Scratch page you translated earlier but it only contains initial code (or no code at all) so you will have to recreate some of the steps - please follow the project instructions. Alternatively, you can first translate the finished project file (see **resources foler** below) and re-use the code from that file to take screenshots.

- Some translated images will need to be edited, for example, the screenshot below has some red circles and a red arrow added. Please save the screenshot of the translated Trinket on your computer and make the required edits in an image editing program, e.g. Paint.

- When your translated images are ready, please upload them via Crowdin Editor to replace the English source file.

- Ideally, GIFs and videos would also be translated but this involves significant amount of work so we donâ€™t expect you to do it. If you decide to translate them but don't know how, please contact Nina (nina@raspbrrypi.org). 

## resources folder

This folder contains all the resources (including an example of a finished project) that an educator might need to teach the project offline. Python (.py), Scratch (.sb2), HTML (.html) files, and graphic files that contain text **should be translated**, and all other files should be ignored.

## yml file

This file contains some meta information about the project and **should be translated**.

## .md files

These files contain the instructions for learners that are displayed on the website. These files **should be translated**.
