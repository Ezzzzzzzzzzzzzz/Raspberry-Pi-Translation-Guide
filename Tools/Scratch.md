# How to translate code in online Scratch editor

If you're a **Translator** or a **Reviewer**, open the project’s Scratch Editor page by going to the Task Manager and clicking the **EN Trinket/Scratch** link. If you’re a **Tester**, there is no need to use the Scratch link from the Task Manager - the translated link will be embedded in the test version of the project.

1. Once in Scratch Editor, please translate the user interface and blocks by clicking on the globe icon and changing the display language. Please remember that this will not translate the names of variables, sprites, costumes, sounds, or text in say/think/ask blocks and operator blocks so you have to translate these manually. You can use our guidelines for translating [Scratch](https://github.com/ninaszymor/Raspberry-Pi-Translation-Guide/blob/master/Technologies/Translating%20Scratch.md).

2. When translated, click Share button:

3. Copy the URL and paste it into the **Translated Trinket/Scratch** cell in the Task Manager.

4. When the code in Scratch is translated/reviewed, you can start translating the project instructions in Crowdin.
