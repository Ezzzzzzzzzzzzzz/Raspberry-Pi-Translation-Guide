# Translating Python

Python is a popular object-oriented programming language, often used for web and app development. Generally, Python code **should not be translated** with the exception of **variable names**, **strings** and **comments**.

- **String** is a sequence of characters, created with single quotes, double quotes or triple quotes:

 - The strings **Hello** and **Here’s a picture of a dog…** should be translated because they will be displayed when the learner runs the programme so it’s important for them to understand what it says.
 
 - If we keep the strings in English, the learner won’t understand what the printed message means. As a rule, the text that’s within **single** ('xx'), **double** ("xx") or **triple** quotes ('''xx''') **should be translated**.
 
 - The function print() (and all other Python functions) should not be translated because if it is, the code won’t work.
 
- **Variables** are used to store information and to access it. Programmer chooses names of variables so they **should be translated** to make them more meaningful to learners.

 - For example, we can create a variable called **_name_** and assign it the value **_Larry_**. We can then ask Python to print the variable **_name_** and it will display **_Larry_** (on the right hand side):

 - The variable name **should be translated** (but please remember not to use any of your language’s special characters):

 - You can also translate the value of the variable (here, **_Larry_**) if it’s a string (i.e. if it’s between single/double/triple quotes) to make it more meaningful to the learners:

 - However, please remember that the value of a variable could be a **Python function**, in which case it **should not be translated**. For example:

- **Comments** are used by programmes to give more details about a given line of code; they are marked with the # sign. These should be translated.
