# Welcome to Raspberry Pi translation community! 

Thank you for joining us and helping us make our curriculum of materials accessible to young people around the world.

This page contains various resources that will help you make the most of our process and will hopefully make your experience with us a great one.

If you have not done this before, please fill in [this form](https://docs.google.com/a/raspberrypi.org/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdoxUvmGwbpx3zcCxXwJEqaBoAQHsTu-v5R4uOTSxv9-OzUEw/viewform) before translating any of our projects. 

### About translation

To ensure high quality, each translation task will typically go through three stages (unless we tell you otherwise):

1. Post-editing: a volunteerr edits a text that was pre-translated using machine translation software. We’ll provide you with a checklist of things to bear in mind while you translate, together with some guidelines for dealing with elements such as images or code.

2. Review: a volunteer reviewer compares the translation to its English original to make sure that nothing has been mistranslated, omitted, or added. We’ll provide you with a list of things to look out for while reviewing.

3. Test: a volunteer tester goes through the translated and reviewed text to try it out and ensure that it can be used for its purpose.

### What you'll translate

Most of the time, we will be translating our learning resources available on the [Raspberry Pi projects](https://projects.raspberrypi.org) website so we focus on these here. We will occasionally have other translation tasks, such as translation of subtitles for our teacher training videos - you will receive instructions for these if the need arises.

Many of our learning resources focus on teaching programming with Scratch, Python, HTML/CSS and JavaScript. Please watch or read the following tutorials to understand how code should be translated:

*	[Translating Python](https://github.com/ninaszymor/Raspberry-Pi-Translation-Guide/blob/master/Technologies/Translating%20Python.md)
* [Translating Scratch](https://github.com/ninaszymor/Raspberry-Pi-Translation-Guide/blob/master/Technologies/Translating%20Scratch.md)
* [Translating HTML/CSS/JavaScript](https://github.com/ninaszymor/Raspberry-Pi-Translation-Guide/blob/master/Technologies/Translating%20HTML.md)

### How you'll translate

We use a translation platform called [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/). It is free to use and is quite simple. Please watch or read the following tutorials to understand how to use Crowdin:

* How to use Crowdin ([read](https://github.com/ninaszymor/Raspberry-Pi-Translation-Guide/blob/master/Tools/Crowdin.md#how-to-use-crowdin) or watch)
* Post-editing in Crowdin ([read](https://github.com/ninaszymor/Raspberry-Pi-Translation-Guide/blob/master/Tools/Crowdin.md#translating-files-machine-translation-for-translators) or watch)
* Reviewing in Crowdin ([read](https://github.com/ninaszymor/Raspberry-Pi-Translation-Guide/blob/master/Tools/Crowdin.md#reviewing-files-for-reviewers) or watch)

### What else you'll need

Apart from Crowdin, we also use few other tools to help us manage the different translations tasks (Jira), and to communicate with each other (Slack). Please watch or read the following tutorials to understand how we use these tools:

* Pi Translation Workspace on Slack (read or watch)
* Pi Translation Task Manager in Jira (read or watch)

### Where to start

To start translating, you will need to set up a Crowdin account and join our Slack workspace and Jira task manager. Once that's done, you can start your first task:

1. Go to the Task Manager and choose a task to post-edit, review or test - see the tutorial. 

2. Go to Crowdin and begin with translating the project code - see the tutorial.

3. When code is translated, you can translate the YML file, the markdown files, the graphic files and GIFs - see the tutorial.

### Questions

If you have any quesions or comments about the process, please contact our Translation Manager (nina@raspberrypi.org).
