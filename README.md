# Welcome to Raspberry Pi translation community! 

The Raspberry Pi Foundation is a UK-based charity that works to put the power of digital making into the hands of people all over the world. 

In order to make our content available globally, we need translations of it in various languages. Professional translation on this scale is expensive, and is therefore unsustainable for a small non-profit organisation such as ours. This is why we need your support — as a translation volunteer, you will make it possible for us to reach millions of children all over the world and help them learn essential digital skills. Thank you for helping us out!

If you have not been in touch with us before, please fill in [this form](https://docs.google.com/a/raspberrypi.org/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdoxUvmGwbpx3zcCxXwJEqaBoAQHsTu-v5R4uOTSxv9-OzUEw/viewform) before translating any of our projects. 

## About our resources

Most of the time, we will be translating our learning resources available on the [Raspberry Pi website](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/) so we focus on these here. We will occasionally have other translation tasks, such as translation of subtitles for our teacher training videos - you will receive instructions for these if the need arises. 

Many of our learning resources focus on teaching programming with Scratch, Python, HTML/CSS and JavaScript. If you’re not familiar with these programming languages, please read the following guidelines which explain what they are and how you should approach them in translation:

-	[Python](https://github.com/ninaszymor/Raspberry-Pi-Translation-Guide/blob/master/Technologies/Translating%20Python.md)
- [Scratch](https://github.com/ninaszymor/Raspberry-Pi-Translation-Guide/blob/master/Technologies/Translating%20Scratch.md)
- [HTML/CSS/JavaScript](https://github.com/ninaszymor/Raspberry-Pi-Translation-Guide/blob/master/Technologies/Translating%20HTML.md)

## About the proccess

To ensure high quality of translations, each project will typically go through three stages (unless we tell you otherwise):

1. Translation: a volunteer translator either translates a text from the beginning, or post-edits a text that was pre-translated using machine translation software. This is done via Crowdin (see **Where to start** below).

2. Review: a volunteer reviewer compares the translation to its English original to make sure that nothing has been mistranslated, omitted, or added. This is done via Crowdin (see **Where to start** below).

3. Test: a volunteer tester goes through the translated and reviewed text to try it out and ensure that it can be used for its purpose. This is done outside of Crowdin - the tester will access the draft version of the project uploaded to our website and will test it by following the project step by step. The link to the test version will be added to Task Manager (see **Where to start** below) once the translation and review have been done, and we uploaded the project to the website.

## Where to start

To start translating, please follow these steps:

1. Set up an account in **Crowdin** - find out how to do it [here](https://github.com/ninaszymor/Raspberry-Pi-Translation-Guide/blob/master/Tools/Crowdin%20account.md). If you’re already signed up to Crowdin account, feel free to use your existing account. However, so that we can verify your contributions, **please make sure** your full name or the email address we have for you is recorded somewhere in your account settings. Find out [how to use Crowdin](https://github.com/ninaszymor/Raspberry-Pi-Translation-Guide/blob/master/Tools/Crowdin.md)

2. Go to our **Task Manager**, select your language from the tabs, and choose the projects you want to translate, review or test. Find out how to use the Task Manager [here](https://github.com/ninaszymor/Raspberry-Pi-Translation-Guide/blob/master/Tools/Task%20Manager.md).

3. Using the correct link from the Task Manager, go to Crowdin to start working on your chosen project. [This document](https://github.com/ninaszymor/Raspberry-Pi-Translation-Guide/blob/master/Tools/Files%20in%20Crowdin.md) explains how to do it step-by-step.

Please note that we are still looking for the best tools for the process so things may change. We will notify you if we replace any of these tools but please **check this document regularly** to see if anything has changed. 

## Questions

If you have any quesions or comments about the process, please contact our Translation Manager (nina@raspberrypi.org).
