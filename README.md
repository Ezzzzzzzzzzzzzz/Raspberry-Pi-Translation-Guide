# Translating for the Raspberry Pi Foundation 

The Raspberry Pi Foundation is a UK-based charity that works to put the power of digital making into the hands of people all over the world. 

Most of the time, we will be translating our learning resources available on the [Raspberry Pi website](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/) so we focus on these here. We will occasionally have other translation tasks, such as translation of subtitles for our teacher training videos - you will receive instructions for these if the need arises. 

Many of our projects focus on teaching programming with Scratch, Python, HTML/CSS and JavaScript. If translators are not familiar with these programming languages, please ask them to read the following guidelines which explain what they are and how they should be approached in translation:

-	[Python](https://github.com/ninaszymor/Raspberry-Pi-Translation-Guide/blob/master/Technologies/Translating%20Python.md)
- [Scratch](https://github.com/ninaszymor/Raspberry-Pi-Translation-Guide/blob/master/Technologies/Translating%20Scratch.md)
- [HTML/CSS/JavaScript](https://github.com/ninaszymor/Raspberry-Pi-Translation-Guide/blob/master/Technologies/Translating%20HTML.md)

## Where to start

To start translating, please follow these steps:

1. Ask each translator to set up an account in **Crowdin** - they can find out how to do it [here](https://github.com/ninaszymor/Raspberry-Pi-Translation-Guide/blob/master/Tools/Crowdin%20account.md). If someone is already signed up to Crowdin, they can use their existing account. However, so that we can verify their contributions, **please make sure** their full name or the email address we/you have for them is recorded somewhere in their account settings. They can then learn [how to use Crowdin](https://github.com/ninaszymor/Raspberry-Pi-Translation-Guide/blob/master-professionals/Tools/Crowdin.md).

2. Go to our **Task Manager**, select the translators' language(s) from the tabs, and choose the projects you want them to translate. 

* Make sure you add the **translator's name** *AND* the **name of your organisation** in the corret cell in the **Translation** column. This will enable us to verify your translators' contributions in Crowdin. For quality control purposes, we will delete any Crowdin contributions that we cannot identify because the contributor's and organisation's names are not listed in the Task Manager.

3. Provide your translators with the **Link for Translation** (available through the Task Manager):

* Translators can now begin translating or post-editing machine translation - [this document explains how to do this step by step](https://github.com/ninaszymor/Raspberry-Pi-Translation-Guide/edit/master-v2/Tools/Files%20in%20Crowdin.md).

* Please make sure you set the **Translation status** cell to **In progress** (see below) to let us know that the translator has begun the task.

4. When the translation is finished, please change the status cell to **Finished**.
