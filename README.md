# Welcome to Raspberry Pi translation community! 

The Raspberry Pi Foundation is a UK-based charity that works to put the power of digital making into the hands of people all over the world. 

In order to make our content available globally, we need translations of it in various languages. Professional translation on this scale is expensive, and is therefore unsustainable for a small non-profit organisation such as ours. This is why we need your support â€” as a an organisation that would like to commit some of its employees' time to translating our projects, you will make it possible for us to reach millions of children all over the world and help them learn essential digital skills. Thank you for helping us out!

## About our projects

Most of the time, we will be translating our learning resources available on the [Raspberry Pi website](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/) so we focus on these here. We will occasionally have other translation tasks, such as translation of subtitles for our teacher training videos - you will receive instructions for these if the need arises. 

Many of our projects focus on teaching programming with Scratch, Python, HTML/CSS and JavaScript. If your volunteers are not familiar with these programming languages, please ask them to read the following guidelines which explain what they are and how they should approach them in translation:

-	[Python](https://github.com/ninaszymor/Raspberry-Pi-Translation-Guide/blob/master/Technologies/Translating%20Python.md)
- [Scratch](https://github.com/ninaszymor/Raspberry-Pi-Translation-Guide/blob/master/Technologies/Translating%20Scratch.md)
- [HTML/CSS/JavaScript](https://github.com/ninaszymor/Raspberry-Pi-Translation-Guide/blob/master/Technologies/Translating%20HTML.md)

## About the proccess

To ensure high quality of translations, each project will typically go through three stages (unless we tell you otherwise):

1. Post-editing: a volunteer post-edits a text that was pre-translated using machine translation software. This is done via Crowdin (see **Where to start** below).

2. Review: a volunteer reviewer compares the translation to its English original to make sure that nothing has been mistranslated, omitted, or added. This is done via Crowdin (see **Where to start** below).

3. Test: a volunteer tester goes through the translated and reviewed text to try it out and ensure that it can be used for its purpose. This is done outside of Crowdin - the tester will access the draft version of the project uploaded to our website and will test it by following the project step by step. The link to the test version will be added to Task Manager (see **Where to start** below) once the translation and review have been done, and we uploaded the project to the website.

## Where to start

To start translating, please follow these steps:

1. Ask each volunteer to set up an account in **Crowdin** - they can find out how to do it [here](https://github.com/ninaszymor/Raspberry-Pi-Translation-Guide/blob/master/Tools/Crowdin%20account.md). If someone is already signed up to Crowdin, they can use their existing account. However, so that we can verify their contributions, **please make sure** their full name or the email address we/you have for them is recorded somewhere in their account settings. They can then learn [how to use Crowdin](https://github.com/ninaszymor/Raspberry-Pi-Translation-Guide/blob/master/Tools/Crowdin.md).

2. Go to our **Task Manager**, select the volunteers' language(s) from the tabs, and choose the projects you want your volunteers to translate, review or test. Find out how to use the Task Manager [here](https://github.com/ninaszymor/Raspberry-Pi-Translation-Guide/blob/master/Tools/Task%20Manager.md).

3. Provide your translation volunteers with the **Link for Translation** (available through the Task Manager) and ask them to begin post-editing machine translation - [this document explains how to do this step by step](https://github.com/ninaszymor/Raspberry-Pi-Translation-Guide/edit/master-v2/Tools/Files%20in%20Crowdin.md).

4. Once a project has been post-edited, provide your review volunteers with the **Link for Review** (available through the Task Manager) and ask them to begin the reivew. They should veryfiy every file in the project (with the exceptions of those we marked as **Do not translate**). 

Please note that we are still looking for the best tools for the process so things may change. We will notify you if we replace any of these tools but please **check this document regularly** to see if anything has changed. 

## Questions

If you have any quesions or comments about the process, please contact our Translation Manager (nina@raspberrypi.org).
