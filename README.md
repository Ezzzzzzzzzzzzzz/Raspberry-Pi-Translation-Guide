# Welcome to Raspberry Pi translation community! 

The Raspberry Pi Foundation is a UK-based charity that works to put the power of digital making into the hands of people all over the world. 

In order to make our content available globally, we need translations of it in various languages. Professional translation on this scale is expensive, and is therefore unsustainable for a small non-profit organisation such as ours. This is why we need your support — as a translation volunteer, you will make it possible for us to reach millions of children all over the world and help them learn essential digital skills. Thank you for helping us out!

If you have not been in touch with us before, please fill in [this form](https://docs.google.com/a/raspberrypi.org/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdoxUvmGwbpx3zcCxXwJEqaBoAQHsTu-v5R4uOTSxv9-OzUEw/viewform) before translating any of our projects. 

## About our resources

Most of the time, we will be translating our learning resources available on the [Raspberry Pi website](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/) so we focus on these here. We will occasionally have other translation tasks, such as translation of subtitles for our teacher training videos - you will receive instructions for these if the need arises. 

Many of our learning resources focus on teaching programming with Scratch, Python, HTML/CSS and JavaScript. If you’re not familiar with these programming languages, please read the following guidelines which explain what they are and how you should approach them in translation:

-	[Python](https://github.com/ninaszymor/Raspberry-Pi-Translation-Guide/blob/master/Technologies/Translating%20Python.md)
- [Scratch](https://github.com/ninaszymor/Raspberry-Pi-Translation-Guide/blob/master/Technologies/Translating%20Scratch.md)
- [HTML/CSS/JavaScript](https://github.com/ninaszymor/Raspberry-Pi-Translation-Guide/blob/master/Technologies/Translating%20HTML.md)

Majority of resources consist of the textual and visual instructions displayed on the [project’s web page](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/rock-band), and an online [Trinket](https://trinket.io/embed/python/33e5c3b81b#.WoV106jFI2w)/[Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/) page that learners use to write and run their code according to the project instructions. Please note that some Trinkets/Scratch pages may be empty while others may already contain some initial code for learners to build on. We need to translate both the project instructions and the initial code. Please carefully read the next two sections (and all the files they link to) to find out how we want you to do it. 

## About the proccess

To ensure high quality of translations, each project will typically go through three stages (unless we tell you otherwise):

1. Translation: a volunteer translator either translates a text from scratch, or edits a text that was pre-translated using machine translation software. We’ll provide you with a checklist of things to bear in mind while you translate, together with some guidelines for dealing with elements such as images or code. This is done through Crowdin (see **Where to start** below).

2. Review: a volunteer reviewer compares the translation to its English original to make sure that nothing has been mistranslated, omitted, or added. We’ll provide you with a list of things to look out for while reviewing. This is done through Crowdin (see **Where to start** below).

3. Test: a volunteer tester goes through the translated and reviewed text to try it out and ensure that it can be used for its purpose. This is done outside of Crowdin - the tester will access the draft version of the project uploaded to our website and will test it by following the project step by step. The link to the test version will be added to Task Manager (see **Where to start** below) once the translation and review have been done, and we uploaded the project to the website.

Most of the time, we will let you know which part of the process we want you to contribute to. However, there will be urgent translations that need to be done quickly, in which case we will let you choose your role in the process. 

## Where to start

To start translating, please follow these steps:

1. Set up an account in Crowdin. Find out how to do it here. 

2. Go to our **Task Manager** and choose the projects you want to translate, review or test. Find out how to use the Task Manager [here](https://github.com/ninaszymor/Raspberry-Pi-Translation-Guide/blob/master/Tools/Task%20Manager.md).

3. Translate the initial project code in Trinket/Scratch. Find out [how to translate code in Trinket](https://github.com/ninaszymor/Raspberry-Pi-Translation-Guide/blob/master/Tools/Trinket.md) and [how to translate code in online Scratch editor](https://github.com/ninaszymor/Raspberry-Pi-Translation-Guide/blob/master/Tools/Scratch.md).

4. Translate the project instructions in Crowdin. Find out [how to use Crowdin](https://github.com/ninaszymor/Raspberry-Pi-Translation-Guide/blob/master/Tools/Crowdin.md) and [how to translate different types of files in Crowdin](https://github.com/ninaszymor/Raspberry-Pi-Translation-Guide/blob/master/Tools/Files%20in%20Crowdin.md)

Please note that we are still looking for the best tools for the process so things may change. We will notify you if we replace any of these tools. 

## Questions

If you have any quesions or comments about the process, please contact our Translation Manager (nina@raspberrypi.org).
