# Translating for the Raspberry Pi Foundation 

The Raspberry Pi Foundation is a UK-based charity that works to put the power of digital making into the hands of people all over the world. 

We are working to translate our learning resources available on the [Raspberry Pi website](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/). Many of the projects focus on teaching programming with Scratch, Python, HTML/CSS and JavaScript. If translators are not familiar with these programming languages, please ask them to read the following guidelines which explain what they are and how they should be approached in translation:

-	[Python](https://github.com/ninaszymor/Raspberry-Pi-Translation-Guide/blob/master/Technologies/Translating%20Python.md)
- [Scratch](https://github.com/ninaszymor/Raspberry-Pi-Translation-Guide/blob/master/Technologies/Translating%20Scratch.md)
- [HTML/CSS/JavaScript](https://github.com/ninaszymor/Raspberry-Pi-Translation-Guide/blob/master/Technologies/Translating%20HTML.md)

## Where to start

To start translating, please follow these steps:

1. Ask each translator to set up an account in **Crowdin** - they can find out how to do it [here](https://github.com/ninaszymor/Raspberry-Pi-Translation-Guide/blob/master/Tools/Crowdin%20account.md). If someone is already signed up to Crowdin, they can use their existing account. However, so that we can verify their contributions, **please make sure** their full name or the email address we/you have for them is recorded somewhere in their account settings. They can then learn [how to use Crowdin](https://github.com/ninaszymor/Raspberry-Pi-Translation-Guide/blob/master-professionals/Tools/Crowdin.md).

2. Our translation manager will provide you with a spreadsheet that lists the projects that need translating together with Crowdin links for the translators to use in order to access the projects. 

+ Please add the **Translator's name** in the corret cell in the spreadsheet. This will enable us to verify your translators' contributions in Crowdin. For quality control purposes, we will delete any Crowdin contributions that we cannot identify because the contributor's name is not listed in the spreadsheet.

3. Provide your translators with the Crowdin links from the spreadsheet. Translators can begin translating or post-editing machine translation - [this document explains how to do this step by step](https://github.com/ninaszymor/Raspberry-Pi-Translation-Guide/blob/master-professionals/Tools/Files%20in%20Crowdin.md).

* Please make sure you set the **Translation status** cell to **In progress** to let us know that the translator has begun the task.

* When the translation is finished, please change the status cell to **Finished**.
