# Welcome to Raspberry Pi translation community! 

Thank you for joining us and helping us make our curriculum of materials accessible to young people around the world.

This page contains various resources that will help you make the most of our process and will hopefully make your experience with us a great one.

If you have not done it yet, please fill in [this form](https://docs.google.com/a/raspberrypi.org/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdoxUvmGwbpx3zcCxXwJEqaBoAQHsTu-v5R4uOTSxv9-OzUEw/viewform) before translating any of our projects. 

### About translation

To ensure high quality, each translation task will typically go through three stages (unless we tell you otherwise):

1. Post-editing: a volunteer edits a text that was pre-translated using machine translation software. Weâ€™ll provide you with some guidelines for dealing with elements such as images or code.

2. Review: a volunteer reviewer compares the translation to its English original to make sure that nothing has been mistranslated, omitted, or added. 

3. Test: a volunteer tester goes through the translated and reviewed text to try it out and ensure that it can be used for its purpose.

### What you'll translate

Most of the time, we will be translating our learning resources available on the [Raspberry Pi projects](https://projects.raspberrypi.org) website so we focus on these here. We will occasionally have other translation tasks, such as translation of subtitles for our teacher training videos - you will receive instructions for these if the need arises.

Many of our learning resources focus on teaching programming with Scratch, Python, HTML/CSS and JavaScript. Please read the following tutorials for some tips on translating code:

*	[Translating Python](https://github.com/ninaszymor/Raspberry-Pi-Translation-Guide/blob/master/Technologies/Translating%20Python.md)
* [Translating Scratch](https://github.com/ninaszymor/Raspberry-Pi-Translation-Guide/blob/master/Technologies/Translating%20Scratch.md)
* [Translating HTML/CSS/JavaScript](https://github.com/ninaszymor/Raspberry-Pi-Translation-Guide/blob/master/Technologies/Translating%20HTML.md)

### How you'll translate

We use a translation platform called [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/). It is free to use and is quite simple. Please watch or read the following tutorials to understand how to use Crowdin:

* How to set up a Crowdin account ([read](https://github.com/ninaszymor/Raspberry-Pi-Translation-Guide/blob/master/Tools/Crowdin%20account.md) or watch)
* How to use Crowdin ([read](https://github.com/ninaszymor/Raspberry-Pi-Translation-Guide/blob/master/Tools/Crowdin.md#how-to-use-crowdin) or watch)
* Post-editing machine translation ([read](https://github.com/ninaszymor/Raspberry-Pi-Translation-Guide/blob/master/Tools/Crowdin.md#translating-files-machine-translation-for-translators) or watch)
* Reviewing translations completed by others ([read](https://github.com/ninaszymor/Raspberry-Pi-Translation-Guide/blob/master/Tools/Crowdin.md#reviewing-files-for-reviewers) or watch)

### What else you'll need

Apart from Crowdin, we also use few other tools to help us manage the different translations tasks (Google Sheets), and to communicate with each other (Slack). Please watch or read the following tutorials to understand how we use these tools:

* Pi Translation Workspace on Slack (read or watch)
* Pi Translation Task Manager in Google Sheets - [read](https://github.com/ninaszymor/Raspberry-Pi-Translation-Guide/blob/master/Tools/Task%20Manager.md) or [watch]().

### Where to start

To start translating, you will need to set up a Crowdin account and join our Slack workspace and Jira task manager. Once that's done, you can start your first task:

1. Go to the Task Manager and choose a task to post-edit, review or test. 

2. Go to Crowdin and begin with translating the project code (read or watch a tutorial).

3. When code is translated, you can translate the `yml` file, the `md` files, the `png` files and `gif` files (read or watch a tutorial).

You can also watch or read our tutorial **Pi Translation in three easy steps**.

### Questions

If you have any quesions or comments about the process, please contact our Translation Manager (nina@raspberrypi.org).
