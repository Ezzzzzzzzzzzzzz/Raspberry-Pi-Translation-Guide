# Welcome to Raspberry Pi translation community! 

The Raspberry Pi Foundation is a UK-based charity that works to put the power of digital making into the hands of people all over the world. 

In order to make our content available globally, we need translations of it in various languages. Professional translation on this scale is expensive, and is therefore unsustainable for a small non-profit organisation such as ours. This is why we need your support — as a translation volunteer, you will make it possible for us to reach millions of children all over the world and help them learn essential digital skills. Thank you for helping us out!

If you’re not registered with us as a translation volunteer, please do so by filling in this form [hyperlink] before translating any of our projects.
